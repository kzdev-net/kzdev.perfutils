# Multi-Threaded StringBuilder Throughput Benchmarks


## Summary 


### Benchmark Operations



### Benchmark Parameters

The following parameters were used in the benchmarks. These will appear as columns in the benchmark results along with the [standard BenchmarkDotNet columns](./stringbuildercache-benchmarks.md#legend).


### HTML Report

Since the benchmark results can create rather large tables, and the Markdown tables can be hard to absorb with the horizontal and vertical table scrolling, the results are also provided in a separate HTML file. 

This can be found [here](./StringsBenchmarks.StringBuilderThroughputBenchmarks-report.html).
